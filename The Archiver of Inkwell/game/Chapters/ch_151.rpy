    #Fade in Getting Caught

    "I'm stunned... I mean I didn't think that it would actually be this easy"

    hc "Are you all right?"

    "My shock was visible even under the hood of the jacket as the cultists ask me, obviously more out of worry than suspicion, but I shouldn't risk being around them for too long."

    hc "I'd get those supplies down quickly if I were you, with The Cleansing happening so soon I'd hate to see you miss it just because of busywork."

    "The friendliness is still an unsettling change compared to how they are to those without their emblematic yellow coats, but I ignore my gut feeling and just press on."

    p "Absolutely. I wouldn't miss The Cleansing for the world!"

    hc "Ha! As if we could even if we wanted to!"

    "They chuckle before resuming their composure."

    hc "But yes, you should get going, did you require any assistance with the supplies? I would be more than happy to show you the way in person."

    p_i "Okay, now this is getting excessive."

    p "Oh no, I'll be fine, I'm sure I'll remember the way once I get on it. Besides, I'm sure you have tasks that need completing as well!"

    p_i "Like getting as far away from me as possible."

    hc "True, true..."

    hc "Well then, I suppose standing around here won't get anything done! It was a pleasure to meet you."

    "They give a courteous bow before walking away."

    p_i "The ritual, huh...?"

    p "Oh, actually!"

    hc "Oh! Yes, did you need something?"

    "The cultist abruptly stops and turns as I stop him."


    p "Yes. Actually..."

    p_i "Maybe I should have thought this out first."

    p "Um, I just realized I've never been to the... um, the site. And I was wondering if there was a quicker way down to the cells?"

    p_i "That was...not great..."

    "The previously jovial demeanor changes for a moment, their lips contour in concern."

    hc "The site?"

    p_i "Oh no."

    "My body tenses up in anticipation of what was about to happen. Will I have to run? Or could I fight them?"

    #finger snap sfx

    hc "OH! Of The Cleansing, you mean?"

    "Their sudden shift again startles me as the finger snap reverates through the hallway."

    hc "Why didn't you just say so? It should be quicker if you go the opposite direction you came in from and hug the left wall!"

    p "Ah, I see. Thank you. I really shouldn't keep you anymore though!"

    hc "Of course. See you at The Cleansing! Remember the left wall!"

    #footsteps sfx

    "Following their direction I quickly make my way to the cells, making sure to be careful of any other, possibly less friendly rain coats."

    "Finally reaching the correct hallway, I check to make sure that the intersecting paths are empty before making my way."

    #play Cult Lore Dump

    "I walk slowly down the stone passage until I reach an opening blocked off by metal bars: a holding cell. Peeking around the corner, I see the girl I've been searching for."

    "Shiori is bound to the wall with chains, glowing red characters waltzing across the cold metal. She looks up and smiles at me."

    shi "Hi! I was wondering when you'd show up."

    p "Is that all you have to say right now?"

    shi "Should I have something else to say?"

    "I can only pinch the bridge of my nose."

    p_i "I guess I should be happy that one of us is cheerful in this situation..."

    p "It's fine. Anyways, we should probably try to get you out of here. How do I get in though?"

    shi "Oh, that's easy. The bars by the wall over there are loose, so you could just squeeze in."

    "She nods toward the side of the cell opposite from where I'm standing as I gauge to see if I can squeeze in."

    shi "But..."

    "I stop in my tracks"

    p "But what?"

    shi "I think it would be better if you don't."

    p "Huh?"

    p "How would that be better?"

    shi "Hmmm."

    "I stare at her with disbelief. Didn't I sneak in here to rescue her?"

    p_i "Did they get to her already?"

    "I fight the urge to check outside and keep my eyes on her"

    p_i "Is this a trap?"

    shi "Don't you ever want to see how a story ends? It's no fun to stop halfway, especially when it's at its climax!"

    p "Come again?"

    "I'm completely stunned at her nonchalant reaction. Is she enjoying this?"

    p_i "She's insane."

    shi "But, I do need you here."

    shi "So will you help me reach the end of this story?"

    p_i "And now I've gone insane."

    p "Sure..."

    "I answered before I had time to think. What does 'helping' her even mean at this point? But I had an inkling that whatever the outcome, this was going to end with me beside her."

    #shio giggle

    shi "I knew I could count on you. Do you still have the book?"

    "Her face turns a bit serious for a moment, a contrast to how she's been this whole time."

    p_i "Well, at least she has a plan right?"

    "I search through the 'supplies' I was carrying earlier. Taking the book I've hidden in the box, I carefully show it to her."

    shi "Good, good."

    "As I do, I hear the soft scratching of a metal tip on paper emanating from the book."

    shi "Could you open it for me?"

    p "Um,sure..."  

    "I take the tome back into my hands briefly and flip it to the most recent page, where details about the runes were written down."

    p "Oh, hey, there's new stuff here."

    Shi "Yippie! Show me."

    "I do my best to present the new inscriptions to her. Shiori turns serious again as her eyes quickly scan the pages, murmuring to herself a few times."

    shi "Okay, perfect."

    "A smile returns to her face."

    #chanting sfx
    #screen shake vfx

    "A sudden vibration can be felt through the compound - it was as if the walls themselves were chanting."

    shi "Okay, I think...it's time for you to go."

    p "Go? But where?"

    shi "The ritual, you have to be there, got it?"

    shi "Please promise me that you'll be there."

    p "Of course..."

    shi "Now go. I'll be there with you as long as you'll be there for me."

    "Before I can ask her or answer any more questions, I feel compelled to leave. So being cautious, I peek around the corners before making my way out of the cell, trying to remember the direction the cultist gave me earlier."

    #fade in from last scene into the cult compound, hallway
    #play At the Cultists Hideout  

    "I quickly left the cells. Sharing that last glance with Shiori, something seemed... reassuring about her, like she isn't as tense as last time I saw her. Definitely can't say the same for me. The more I learn about the whole situation, the more confusing it gets."

    #fade into Ritual Sacrifice Scene 

    "Slowly making my way towards the ritual site, I feel a wave of nausea hit me."

    #slight screen shake

    "It's not too bad at first, barely a bother, but every few steps I take, the gut-wrenching feeling intensifies..."

    #screen shake
    #thud

    "... Until all I could do to not collapse was to brace myself against the cold hallway walls."

    #screen edge darken alongside shake

    "Trying to regain my composure, I close my eyes"

    "There was a part of me that wanted to shut my eyes and forcefully rouse myself awake. This, whatever this was, was way over my head."

    "My memories kept lapsing, it was getting harder to remember anything, all but the moments I've spent with Shiori..."

    p "Ugh!"

    #fade in distant rain vfx

    "My head races with memories that I can't keep track of. Like rain hitting an umbrella, they slowly join into a singular stream, each pitter-patter worsening my headache. Are they from before? Yesterday? Have they even happened yet? Is any of it real?"

    #rain vfx slowly grow louder
    #screen becomes blurry with slight vertigo distortion

    "I struggle to hold myself on the cold, wet, wall of the compound. Each glimpse weakens my resolve."

    "But in between the torrent of thoughts washing over me..."

    #fade in black and white screenshots from earlier scenes with Shiori
    #volume on bgm lowers

    p "Shiori..."

    "My memories of Shiori slowly center me, helping me regain a bit of my composure."

    #rain vfx quiets

    "I take a deep breath and try my best to calm myself. I let open the floodgates, and while the headache threatens to resurface, it washes off into a inky black hole within. Draining away."

    #rain vfx stops

    p "This isn't just about me anymore..."

    #fade into At the Cultists Hideout

    "I mutter to myself, letting the strange calmness run through me."

    #footsteps vfx

    "And without a thought to a direction, I resume walking. Reaching a turn in the hallway, I carefully check to make sure I don't alert anyone and continue forward. I make sure to hug the left wall as told."
    
    "Just as I started to question if the directions should be trusted, I hear murmurs and footsteps all moving towards one direction. It seems like the labyrinth of corridors all lead to one place as I trail, then join, a group of raincoats moving towards a large exit."

    #fade into the field
    #fade into At the Ritual
    #rain vfx
    #murmur vfx

    "The sound of chanting gets louder as I finally make my way outside. I take a moment to take in the scene. It seems like they've had the compound connected to Inkwell Hill, and the 'ritual site' is just the field on top."

    "The swarm of yellow jackets parted around me without taking notice, muttering indecipherable words."

    #walking in puddle vfx

    "I follow suit and lower my head, ad-libbing the words to replicate the chants around me until my eyes notice..."

    p "What in the..."

    "The puddles of water under our feet are crystal clear, clearer than any water I'd seen before. So clear that it's as if we are stepping on air, with ripples being the only indication that what I'm looking at is indeed water."

    #walking in puddle vfx end

    p "...world?"

    "Like an overflowing cup, the water spills and spills. Past my feet. Past the hill."

    #Screen change into overview of town(?)

    "And it overflows into strands of small rivers, some directly into the town, others breaking off and flanking into the different corners of the city. And some went further beyond the horizon. It almost seems like..."

    p_shi "Tentacles."

    #Distortion effect on town

    "Something in my mind speaks to me. It's familiar, almost like a mismatched combination of Shiori's and my own."

    p_i "But yeah, tentacles, or maybe tendrils?"

    "I focus my eyes for a moment, and I can almost imagine the streams converging onto the town, like worms crawling underneath skin, looking for..."

    p_shi "Look up."

    "Another thought strikes my mind, again tinged with Shiori's voice."

    "My body instinctively follows my thought, or was it a command?"

    #Transition into sky, still gray

    "The gray sky is almost a reprieve from the chaotic visage of the town. It was never a selling point, since you're always bound to find a gray cloud or two. But recent events have pushed me to appreciate the predictable and mundane."

    "Until..."

    p_shi "Try and focus underneath it all."

    #Slight distortion on sky, similar to the earlier

    "I saw IT."

    #Increased distortion
    #Footstep and rain vfx fades

    "IT."

    "What is IT?"

    p_shi "Breathe. You have to understand."

    "IT was squirming under the sky and in the spaces between."

    "IT was shaped like a sea creature. Is it a shark? Megalodon?"

    #Distortion increases

    "No. IT was more ancient then either. Maybe they were some sort of partially formed and aborted offspring?"

    #Edge of screen darkens, slight shake vfx

    "A wave of nausea hits me, but my gaze is transfixed on IT's shape. Always reshaping, almost as if its body is composed of writhing and wriggling worms unceasing and ever-shifting.. ITs limbs, if it has any to begin with, appear and disappear, stretch and shrink with the rest of its body. The only constant is that of movement and hunger."

    "My eyes stop being my own as my neck stiffens to hold my head upright. They continue to try and follow IT's movements, first slowly, but then quicker and quicker. It tried to focus on IT's worm-like body, then IT's indecipherable shape. Then back to the body then shape. Body then shape. Body. Shape."

    #increased shake vfx

    "Then my eyes stopped cooperating, focusing on different parts of the vast distortion of space."

    "Am I standing on the floor? Or am I orbiting around IT? I feel my knees buckle as my body threatens to fall from the vertigo."

    "Left."

    "Right."

    "Up."

    p_shi "Down."

    "My head moves down instantly as my own voice pierces through it all."

    #Shake effect stops 
    #Screen returns to normal

    p_shi "Focus."

    #muttering and rain vfx returns

    p_i "I have to focus."

    "I tell myself as the surroundings return to normal. Or as normal as chanting and invisible rain could be..."

    "Realizing I've been standing for too long, I keep my head down as I follow the crowd. I try to shake off the nausea, muttering nonsense to fit in with the chanting."

    #footsteps vfx
    #background shifts to closer to the stage, the stage is now visible

    "The masses of raincoats stop and huddle around a lone stage."

    #zoom into stage

    "It's a rickety old thing, so it's a miracle it can even stand. And it almost seems pathetically small for this grand gathering. So pathetically small and bare bones that it almost seems like it would fit better in some sort of a cheesy youth camp than it does here, gathering the attention of a crowd like this."

    #muttering stops
    #silence except for singular steps vfx

    "For a moment everything goes silent, even the raindrops go quiet, as solitary steps in the puddles can be heard."

    "Then through a parting in the crowd, I see a figure, cloaked like the rest, slowly stepping through, head down, muttering like the others and heading towards the platform."

    #creaking steps sfx

    "The figure slowly climbs up the steps, each step deliberate."

    cl "..."

    "They stood atop the stage, their presence somehow making it seem more grandiose than it was just a few moments ago. Their face, covered in the very same raincoat as all the other members, was androgynous, and like the rest of their body, very hard to describe with any detail. It's as if they are a blank canvas of a human."

    "Taking a few breaths, the leader speaks in a soft, yet affirming voice.While quiet, it feels as if they are directly addressing each one of us." 

    cl "My fellow brothers and sisters."

    cl "It is wonderful to see so many of you on this auspicious day..."

    "I kept my head down like the rest of the crowd, resisting its lull."

    cl "It is beautiful to see so many of you here."

    cl "Some of you, I've known since the inception of our family, while others are much newer members of the flock. But there are a few..."

    "I suddenly feel sharp eyes on me, taking all my willpower to not raise my head to meet the unseen gaze."

    cl "... who are interlopers, intending harm upon the family. Know this..."

    "My jaw clenches. I hang on every word, my heart beat almost matching the rhythm of their voice, ready to jump at any moment"

    cl "...you are welcome among us. Just like everyone here, we are all the same to the family. And even more importantly, the Wyrm..."

    #brief screen shake

    "Another wave of nausea reverberates through me. I grit my teeth and let it pass the best I can, trying to hold my composure."

    cl "...sees us for what we truly are, insignificant..."

    "The congregation slowly murmurs around in unison, too quietly to tell what exactly... but it seems as if they are chanting a variant of what their leader is saying."

    cl "...polluted..."


    "I hear another figure moving through the crowd."

    cl "...meaningless..."

    "Just like the leader, I can hear bodies shifting away, letting whoever it is through."

    cl "...and without purpose..."

    "Yet they seem different. This one is more erratic, a step or two out of sync compared to the leader's. Are they...  intentionally  skipping a few steps?"

    "Each word seems to drain me more and more, as if each word pulled on my very soul, dragging it from my body. Away to somewhere else."

    cl "...BUT WE KNOW THE TRUTH..."

    "The sudden shift in the tone startles me, as I can hear a sea of heads look up in unison.."

    p_i "Not again..."

    "I already know where they are looking at: the distortion above us where the ugly, writhing entity is embedded in the sky, churning out nausea and madness."

    cl "We become so much more once we accept the void..."


    "I reluctantly raise my head, bracing to fight off the repulsive mass, until I see..."

    p_i "Shiori?!"

    "Shiori's standing on the platform with her hands bound."

    "Our eyes meet as she gives me a reassuring smile. She quickly turns away before drawing any attention."

    "The leader speaks up again after a moment, pointing towards Shiori."

    cl "The moment arrives, my brothers and sisters! The Archiver must comply! Isn't that right?"

    p_i "Comply? And that word again... Archiver?"

    shi "Yes... the Archiver is obligated to release the information if..."

    cl "YOU HEARD HER FAMILY!"

    #shio pout (if we have it)

    "Shiori gets startled as she is interrupted by the leader, and... she pouts?"

    p_i "Is she taking this seriously at all?"

    cl "THE CLEANSING CAN SOON BEGIN..."

    "As soon as the word 'cleansing' is heard, a unified thud echoes throughout the area as all the members suddenly fall to their knees. The sudden movement catches me off guard as I try to copy their movements."

    cl "Drink, my brothers and sisters."

    "The leader, still standing, lifts a goblet above their head, as does the rest of the congregation follow suit. They bow forward and cup the water pooling on the ground."

    p_i "Am I supposed to follow along?"

    "But before I can ponder any longer, my arms copy their movements, until I have the unnaturally clear water only an inch away from my face."

    "I notice strange black specks floating about in my cupped hand. Has...was that always been there?"

    p_i "Wait. Is that... ink?"

    cl "Let us drink so that the Great Wyrm may use our sinned souls as a kindling to cleanse the wickedness from the world."

    "My body instinctively pulls my cupped hands forward, putting them to my lips before I drink it alongside everyone else. It's surprisingly flavorless, except for a tinge of..."

    p_i "The ink she gave me...?"


    cl "ARISE, MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS!"

    "We all stand up, this time, in perfect unison."

    p_i "What's going on?"

    "I suddenly feel a familiar sensation that I just escaped a few minutes back."

    #screen shakes and thud vfx

    p_i "Not... this again..."

    "I dig my heels in, as the ground continues shaking underneath me. The others aren't so, toppling over one another like dominoes."

    cl "Huh...?"

    "The leader, still one of the few standing, turns to Shiori, and for the first time I see their face light up with emotion."

    cl "You! What did you do?!"

    "They scream out, their voice laced with desperation. Shiori looks at them with... pity?"

    shi "I did what you asked me to. I {i}complied{/i}, and released the knowledge."

    "Shiori answers nonchalantly, the restraints turning into ink-like liquid before dropping onto the floor."  

    cl "NO!"

    "The leader clumsily lunged at Shiori, their calm and soft features morphing into something feral."

    cl "Augh...!"

    "Shiori casually sidestepped the attempt with a twirl before grabbing them by the collar."

    cl "Damn you!"

    "They struggled for a moment before realizing that Shiori was dangling them off the ledge."

    shi "Seems like you're further gone than I thought..."

    "Pondering for a moment, Shiori glances over at me, a subtle smile forming before she motions towards the exit that I came through."

    p_shi "I'll catch up."

    #running sfx
    #change scene to field

    "Before I can process what's happening, I'm on my feet running towards the exit. The last I see of Shiori, she flicks the flailing leader's forehead and they go limp. With no time to think, I do my best to avoid the unconscious bodies and ignore those with enough strength to still be conscious."

    #change scene to exit

    "Happy to finally leave that hellhole behind me, I nearly ran past Shiori leaning against the exit, nonchalantly waiting for me. I'm barely able to stop, landing myself halfway through the exit and the entrance."

    #bgm fades into After Escape

    shi "Wow! The ink did a number on your speed, huh? I was hoping I could catch my breath for a bit, but look at you zoomin'."

    #shi giggle

    "She giggles at her own joke, her voice tinged with a mix of slight admiration and surprise. She puts herself between me and the hill. "

    p "Ho... how did you get here so fast...?"

    "I ask her in between deep breaths as I realize how hard I've pushed my body. She puts her hand on her chin."

    shi "Is that really the question you want answers to?"

    #parts of the background turn black, like raindrop painting it black

    shi "Before I can answer any questions, I'm going to need you to focus on me for a bit, okay?"

    "I try to answer but the words never come out. Everything except Shiori slowly begins to fade, making it hard to focus on anything but her."

    #more portions in the background turn black
    #bgm get quieter to 75% (is possible)

    shi "I guess the most important thing you'd want ask is 'what the heck just happened?'"

    #shi giggle

    "Her imitation of my tone echos far more than it should, as if we are in a small hallway."

    #only Shiori is visible now, isolated in black
    #bgm get quieter to 50% (is possible)

    shi "Hmmmm. The best way to explain it would be..."

    "Her finger presses on her chin again, looking up at an nonexistent ceiling"

    shi "Imagine that those guys needed a key, and then imagine the key is like a paragraph. Hmmm, maybe that doesn't make sense?"

    shi "Okay, but then imagine it's like I chopped up that paragraph into individual letters... Then I mixed up the letter into the {i}water{/i} you guys drank, like it was alphabet soup, yeah!"

    "My vision slowly fades as I struggle to pay attention to her..."

    shi "Or maybe it should be called alphabet water? Would that be any good?" 

    "I fall onto my knees, as she approaches me. Was it from fatigue, or is this something else entirely...?"

    #vision slightly falters before focusing again
    #bgm get quieter to 25% (is possible)

    shi "Oh, you poor thing..."

    "She gently taps the top of my head with her palm."

    shi "There, there. This must have been tough for you, huh? I guess mixing ink with rainwater isn't the best, huh?"

    #shio giggle

    shi "Maybe you should sleep for now. Take care of yourself okay? We'll talk after you get plenty of rest, okay?"

    "Before I can muster up the energy to say anything, Shiori taps my forehead..."

    #bgm silence

    shi "And boop."

    "Is all I hear before my body gives up and collapses. I fell unconscious right before hitting the ground."

    #screen fades to black + shio giggle

    p_i "Kinda feels like my bed..."

    #slowly fade in to library + book turning + cats meow + bird chirp vfx
    #fade into Prologue 

    p "yawn~"

    p_i "Did I fall asleep again?"

    "I slowly wake up and stretch, letting the sun warm up my face as I rub the sleepiness out of my eyes. Even after a couple of weeks, I still dream of everything that's occurred. The cult. IT. The Archiver. It's still surreal."

    "I hear the cats meowing and the bird chirping from the open door, begging for food. Speaking of which..."

    p_i "Where is she?"

    "I don't even have a chance to warm up my voice and call for her when I sense a presence behind me."

    shi "BOO!"

    p "Gosh darn!"

    "I nearly jumped out of the seat. The cats, apparently used to Shiori's shenanigans, look up lazily before returning their attention to more important matters as they sunbathe by the windows."

    #meow + shio giggle sfx

    shi "Did I get you?"

    p "I mean... yes. But I just woke up, so it's not exactly fair..."

    "Shiori ignores my reply with a posh, mocking response"

    shi "You know, a {i}proper{/i} Novelknight wouldn't be asleep at the library."

    p "Oh. Well, apologies my highness!"

    "With a soft bow, I reply with one of my own, nearly hitting my head on the table."

    #shio giggle

    shi "You are forgiven this time. Do not let it happen again!"

    "She answers with a smile, putting down a few books she must have been looking for while I was asleep."

    "Taking a seat across from me, she quickly opens up a familiar book. I let a few minutes pass, enjoying the unusually warm sun."

    p "So... what's next?"

    "Shiori's ears perk up, but she immediately doesn't respond. A few moments later, she looks up from the text, her head slightly tilted and eyes deep in thought. "

    shi "Hmm?"

    "Twirling with her hair, she looks out the window where the birds were enjoying the afternoon sun. The cats occasionally rise to a crouch, debating on whether to pounce on them or not."

    shi "Well, I don't think sticking around the town is going to do much good for either of us."

    "Shiori isn't too far off. Things are more or less getting back to normal. We even get the occasional sun now. But it seems like the town would rather forget that anything ever happened, or maybe it needed to. People would occasionally give me weird looks, or stare as if they wanted to say something before moving along."

    p "Yeah... And it's not like either of us really had anything in the town, other than each other's company anyway."

    shi "Ha! Speak for yourself. I had my books! Still, you could go back to school you know? I'm sure it'll be easier for you if you stopped hanging around me..."

    p_i "No Shiori, huh?"

    p "..."

    shi "..."

    #meow and chirp vfx

    shi "..."

    p "After everything I've seen, felt, and experienced? Nah, life's going to get boring without you. Whatever you say or do, I think you'll be stuck with this Novelight!"

    shi "It's Naav-a-leet!"

    "Shiori laughed at my obvious provocation. The birds, finally realizing that the cats were getting too close for comfort, flew off."

    p "So, again. What's next?"

    shi "Hmmm..."

    shi "Ever want to visit a place brimming with magic and wonder?"
