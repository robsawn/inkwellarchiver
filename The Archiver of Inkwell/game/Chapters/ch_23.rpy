    k "Still it is very much in line with the plot of that book. Unfortunately, you aren't as reliable as the knight in the story, shame. Some things are identical to the story, while others are completely different."

    p "Wait, if you read all of it, then you must know the whole plot! Why are we even trying to find the monster and learn of its weaknesses if we can just read the book? But I left it in my room..."

    k "Smart, aren't you? It was the first thing we tried, of course. But because the worlds merged, something has changed, and not everything is the same as in the story."

    k "Rook is the only one we have who actually fought the monster in the book. When we met, he told us all the weaknesses of the monster, but none of them worked."

    p "So it has no weaknesses?! We're doomed."

    k "No, you buffoon. It just means that it has new weaknesses. Just like we are filling in for the knights of the story, the world is substituting the weaknesses of the monster. We need to find common ground, something similar to what the monster was weak to before."

    k "I don't know. It doesn't appear to have good hearing either, or you would have given us away already. Maybe it feels out people's dreams or souls or something. I don't want to test it just yet."
