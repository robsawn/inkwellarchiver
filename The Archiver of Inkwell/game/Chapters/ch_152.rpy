label ch_152:
    "Finally slowing down to catch my breath, I take stock of my surroundings. All around me there are dark brick walls. Droplets echo mixed with the slight clinking of chains - they are the only sounds I hear."

    "I walk slowly down the stone passage until I reach an opening blocked off by metal bars: a holding cell. Peeking around the corner, I see the girl I've been searching for."

    "Shiori is bound to the wall with chains,glowing red characters waltzing across the cold metal. She looks up and smiles at me."

    shi "Hi! I was wondering when you'd show up."

    p "Is that all you have to say right now?"

    shi "Should I have something else to say?"

    "I can only pinch the bridge of my nose."

    p_i "Somehow, I'm not surprised."

    p "It's fine. Anyway, we should probably try to get you out of here. How do I get in though?"

    shi "Oh, that's easy. The bars by the wall over there are loose, so you could just squeeze in."

    "She nods toward the side of the cell opposite from where I'm standing as I see if I squeeze in."

    "I kneel down next to Shiori and start inspecting the chains for any kind of lock, but there isn't one…"

    p "How did they even get these on you? I don't see a hinge."

    shi "Oh, they just kinda appeared on me."

    "I hear a soft scratching of a metal tip on paper, and pull out the book, opening it to the next page. There are some details about the runes on the newest page."

    p "Oh, hey, there's new stuff here, maybe-"

    shi "Look out!"

    p "Wha-"

    "Before I can process anything, everything goes black."

    # snap to black

    "I'm woken up by rain drops pelting against my face. I'm on the move, I think, being carried along by people in yellow raincoats. Yellow. That, and the roiling clouds above me are all I can see."

    "Moving further and further in, the crowd parts, revealing a lone stage. There's some kind of altar on top of it. I can hear rough splashing and struggling, accompanied by the rattling of chains behind me."

    p_i "That must be the leader… That feeling around them…"

    "There's more struggling and clinking behind me."

    shi "Let them go! They have nothing to do with this!"

    cl "Of course they do."

    "The leader's voice is calm and self-assured."

    shi "What?! What are you talking about?"

    cl "They have sinned, just as we all have: they existed and dare imagined some significance for themselves."

    "There's a hanging silence while Shiori and I process what we just heard."

    cl "Before the Great Void Wyrm, we are all nothing and we are all insignificant."

    cl "You and that… {i}filth{/i}… shall open the gate for the Great Wyrm, and they shall bless us by cleansing this world of all."

    shi "It's not what you think it is. That monster is going to consume everything. That's all it knows how to do."

    "A dry smack resounds, timed with a sharp inhale."

    cl "How DARE you?! How dare you call our Lord a 'monster'?! Know your place, Archiver!"

    cl "I will hear no more of this!"

    "The leader storms past me, not sparing me a glance. Throughout the whole exchange, we only drew closer, and now, the altar was right in front of us. A stone altar decorated with the same dancing red runes that were on Shiori's chains."

    "Shiori is brought up next to me, and I can finally see her expression. She shakes her head with a frown and looks toward me, as if to make sure I'm okay."

    shi "Sorry, I didn't think it'd go quite like this. I thought it'd be different."

    p "I want to say it's ok, but… Anyway, do we have a chance of getting out of this?"

    shi "I really don't think so…"

    "I study her face, searching for that 'gotcha' moment. She must be joking, or she's going to keep talking and come up with a plan to get us out of this." 

    "But nothing."

    p "Wait. This is it?"

    shi "Well, it probably won't be the 'end' end, but... It'll be rough."

    p "Rough? How so?"

    shi "I would really rather not talk about that."

    "Shiori's reluctance to talk about it only serves to amplify my ever-increasing anxiety."

    "Suddenly, I feel cold metal wrap around my wrists and ankles, and I am pulled into a kneeling position next to the altar, my hands on the stone. The runes from the stone wrap around my fingers, binding me even firmer in place." 

    "I look over and see Shiori in the same position, but for some reason, she doesn't seem to be as tightly bound as I am. The runes flicker as Shiori's eyes glow golden for just a moment."

    "The leader comes up on the stage, their back to us. Their presence seems even more ominous than it was just a few moments ago. There's no way for me to truly describe them. It's as if they were a blank canvas of a human."

    "Taking a few breaths, they speak in a soft, yet affirming voice. While quiet, it feels as though they are addressing each one of us."

    cl "My fellow brothers and sisters."

    cl "It is wonderful to see so many of you on this auspicious day..."

    "There's a mounting pain in my hands, like a hundred needles dancing across my skin. I look away from the speaker to my hands and see the runes carving themselves into my skin. I wince, but can't make any noise."

    #shio-frown if we have one

    "Glancing over at Shiori, I notice that she's fine. No runes, no pain.. She catches my gaze and her eyes dart over to my hands, and back to me, shaking her head, a face full of regrets."

    shi "..."

    p_i "I guess she can't help me right now."

    cl "It is beautiful to see so many of you here."

    cl "Some of you, I've known since the inception of our family, while others are much newer members of the flock."

    cl "Today, we are joined by the Archiver and her companion..."

    "I feel the pressure of a thousand eyes on me. My body wants to shake, but all I feel is the cold rain dripping and sliding down my skin."

    cl "As we know, the Great Void Wyrm sees us for what we truly are..."

    "The congregation slowly murmurs in unison, too quietly to tell what exactly… but it seems as if they are chanting a variant of what their leader is saying."

    cl "... insignificant..."

    "My jaw clenches as a wave of nausea racks my body. I let it pass as best as I can, but it only subsides a little."

    cl "... polluted..."

    "Another wave of pressure as if I'm being crushed by a staggering weight."

    cl "... meaningless and without purpose!"

    "As they begin to speak in a language I don't recognize and my nausea gets worse. The pain in my hands shoots up my arms, and an unbearable pressure falls on the area, like the sky itself is crushing me."

    "I raise my head, compelled, to see..."

    "IT."

    "IT's an ugly and roiling, writhing mass in the sky, churning out nausea and madness."

    p "AAAAHHHHHH!!"

    p "FUUUUU-"

    "My voice seizes and I can't scream anymore."

    "All I'm left with is my pain. A pain corrupting my thoughts. Slithering around… my mind is turning... foul."

    p_i "These people! Let me be! Is that so wrong?! Stop!"

    "Struggling to turn my head, I finally see Shiori gritting her teeth too. Her eyes glow again, and the runes flicker. In that brief moment, she rips her hands free, trying to hide that her hands are free now."

    "Shiori meets my gaze, her eyes on the verge of tears seeing the pain I'm in. She rests a hand on my arm, her touch feeling like a cooling salve. Her eyes glow again, and my runes flicker as well, the pain lessening and my mind clearing a little."

    "Inching my head over my shoulder, I can see the crowd has dispersed, watching from a distance. Their attention is completely on IT above us. I don't know when that happened. I don't know how long we've been here. All I know is pain, Shiori, and IT above me."

    p "... That must be... Wyrm… talking about..."

    "I'm surprised I'm able to talk, and it seems Shiori is too."

    shi "Yeah. I'm trying to get us out of these shackles, so try to hang on, okay?"

    "I can only nod, my teeth gritted. My jaw is locked, and I don't think I'll be able to open it again."

    # fade to black and back

    "How long has it been?. I think the runes are flickering more and more." 

    # fade to black and back

    p_i "Pain. Can't talk. Can't noise."

    p_i "Stop. Please."

    #fade to black and back

    p_i "Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop."

    #fade to black and back

    shi "It's okay, the runes are gone... I don't know if you can still hear me, but we're getting out of here. The Wyrm is still above us, but we need to get out of here."

    p_i "Pain."

    shi "I wish you didn't have to go through this..."

    p_i "Carried? Stop? Stop..."

    shi "Yeah, that's right. I'll carry you out of here. It's gonna be a bit rough, but I won't let you suffer any longer."

    # fade to black and back

    "I look around bleary-eyed, my surroundings a blur. Shiori's carrying me in her arms, running faster than I thought possible. The ground cracks all around as the sky descends into a pitch black."

    shi "Looks like you're coming out of it a little, that's good. You're doing great, just keep trying to think, okay?"

    "I can only see her face, concern written all over, tears streaming down."

    shi "Alright, we should be good here for now."

    "I let my head lazily roll to the side, then the other. I don't recognize anything here."

    p_i "Where?"

    shi "We're... in your apartment. You really don't recognize it, huh?"

    "There's a sniffling. I can't focus on it, or anything."

    shi "Go ahead and close your eyes..."

    # fade to black

    shi "Focus on my voice, and try to relax a little..."

    shi "Everything's going to be okay..."

    shi "You did really well, and..."

    shi "I'm proud of you. I'll never forget you, Novelite."

    p_i "Mean?"

    shi "You can rest, as long as you need to."

    "More sniffling."

    p_i "Rest?"

    shi "Yep, rest. Good job, and goodnight."
