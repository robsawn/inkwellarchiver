    "Finally slowing down to catch my breath, I take stock of my surroundings. All around me there are dark brick walls. Droplets echo mixed with the slight clinking of chains - they are the only sounds I hear."

    "I walk slowly down the stone passage until I reach an opening blocked off by metal bars: a holding cell. Peeking around the corner, I see the girl I've been searching for."

    shi "Oh, that's easy. The bars by the wall over there are loose, so you could just squeeze in."

    "She nods toward the side of the cell opposite from where I'm standing as I see if I squeeze in."

    "I kneel down next to Shiori and start inspecting the chains for any kind of lock, but there isn't one..."

    p "How did they even get these on you? I don't see a hinge."

    shi "Oh, they just kinda appeared on me."

    "I hear a soft scratching of a metal tip on paper, and pull out the book, opening it to the next page. There are some details about the runes on the newest page."

    p "I want to say it's ok, but... Anyway, do we have a chance of getting out of this?"

    shi "I really don't think so..."

    "I study her face, searching for that 'gotcha' moment. She must be joking, or she's going to keep talking and come up with a plan to get us out of this."

    "Shiori's reluctance to talk about it only serves to amplify my ever-increasing anxiety."

    "Suddenly, I feel cold metal wrap around my wrists and ankles, and I am pulled into a kneeling position next to the altar, my hands on the stone. The runes from the stone wrap around my fingers, binding me even firmer in place."

    "I look over and see Shiori in the same position, but for some reason, she doesn't seem to be as tightly bound as I am. The runes flicker as Shiori's eyes glow golden for just a moment."

    "The leader comes up on the stage, their back to us. Their presence seems even more ominous than it was just a few moments ago. There's no way for me to truly describe them. It's as if they were a blank canvas of a human."
