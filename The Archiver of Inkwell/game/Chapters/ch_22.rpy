    "Despite the harsh storm, I am able to get home relatively quickly. Thankfully, I managed to keep the books dry. It would have been a hassle to explain to the librarian if they were damaged..."

    "Putting the books aside on the table, I start looking for what to have for dinner tonight. Maybe adding a cucumber would be good. I just hope it's not rotten."

    "While the food is being cooked, I pick up the recommended fantasy book from the pile for a closer look."

    p "'Hunter of Nightmare', huh? Sounds kinda generic, but oh well. She did recommend it to me. Doesn't hurt to take a peek."

    "The first few pages start with the story of a man looking for his childhood friend who disappeared long ago. But very recently he received a message from her out of nowhere, asking for help. He didn't know specifically what she needed, but he decided to set off immediately."

    "His journey led him to an eerie forest cursed by nightmares. Creatures born here were manifestations of twisted dreams that represented every fear known to mankind." 

    "Because of this, everyone avoided the place. No traces of civilization could be found anywhere close, as humans naturally attract monsters with their fears, empowering them and birthing more horrifying creatures. A vicious cycle that dissuaded even the bravest of kingdoms from stepping near."

    "Recently, there were rumors that even the weather near the forest had turned hostile. A constant rain surrounded the forest like a barrier, showing that no one was welcome."

    "And yet, for some reason, the man's friend was here, asking for help after years of silence."

    "But the man wasn't afraid. Despite the dangers, he headed for the forest, determined to challenge its nightmares with sword and sorcery."

    "His journey was perilous. To get to the forest, he needed to brave the storms and lightning. Many a bolt struck close, yet he endured and pushed through the harsh weather."

    "Entering the forest, he found it quieter than he imaginedâ€”too quiet, in fact. Not a single sound could be heard, not even the wind. The trees inside were malformed, with their branches clinging to him like hands. The roots were no better, snarling around his legs to obstruct his path."

    "After a long day of traveling, the man decided to take a short break. After all that he endured, he needed to rest. Yet, the forest would not give him that. While trying to find a place to sleep, a bright light suddenly flashed from the darkness, prompting him to investigate, sword in hand."

    "What he saw was unlike anything in heaven or earth.  It was taller than the man, hunched and twisted, with naught for a face but horns and fangs and a mane of blazing azure that ran down its back to the end of its heavy rat-like tail."

    "Three-fingered hands grasped at the end of gangly arms, and knobbly legs terminated in cloven hooves. Its chest, gaunt and glowing like a ghostly furnace, heaved as it bellowed at the interloper."

    "Suddenly, it jumped on the knight, intending to rip him to shreds with its claws, but he dodged and struck the monster back. However, the weight of the blow felt different. Rather, there was no weight at all. The sword never struck the monster. It went through it as if it wasn't even there."

    "As the man wasn't ready for this, his momentum caused him to lose his footing. With tree roots restricting his movements, the monster loomed over him, raising its claw as it prepared to strike him down."

    "I am interrupted by the sudden noise of boiling water. I was so absorbed in reading that I forgot to man the stove, and now the pot boiled over... Great..."

    "I throw the book on the table, saving it for later, as I go to save my dinner. After successfully filling my stomach and cleaning up, I am faced with the hardest choice known to man:"

    "To do homework or not to do homework? That is the question. Looking at the pile of books from the library, it becomes obvious that it will take a long time to read all of them."

    "I sigh. As much as I like leaving things until the last moment, it's better for me to focus on them now. The story can wait."

    "I fought with the monster named history for hours, but it finally succeeded in bringing about my demise."

    "Tired of this losing battle, I decided to give it a rest. The rain outside has finally ended, so it's quiet enough for me to sleep soundly, anyway. And so, good night!"

    "I turn around. I see a bright blue fire chasing after me. It can feel its heat scorching my skin even from far away."

    "I continue to run, but it is useless. The fire is hounding me, gaining speed faster than a car. A collision is inevitable."

    "I look back again and see that it is closer. With just a brief glance, I think it is holding out its hand, trying to reach for my throat."

    "I run and I run, until I can run no more. The creature moves closer and closer with each step I don't take. The heat spreads more the longer I don't move. So I leap into the void, praying it will shield me from the flames."

    p "... Just a nightmare, huh? Phew."

    "As I reach my right hand to wipe the sweat from my face, I feel a slight sting. Looking at it, there seem to be burn marks on it. The same happened on my left hand as well."

    p "Eh, when did this happen? Was it from the pot? Good thing I have some burn cream in the cabinet."

    "While tending to my wounds, I pour myself some water, trying to shake off the dread. They say that rain helps you relax, so I look outside. Looking at the droplets falling down makes me feel sleepy again. Finally, a benefit to living in this city."

    "The air is fresh, despite the gloomy sky, and it feels comfortable to stroll around with the raindrops landing softly on my umbrella overhead."

    "As I continue my walk, I stumble upon a road in disrepair that leads to a nearby forest. I remember going there a lot as a child. Now it was all overgrown due to negligence."

    "At the same time, thoughts about the odd girl from yesterday cross my mind. I really want to see her again, so I should finish up that book quickly so we have something to talk about."

    "While distracted by my thoughts, I stepped on a stick, breaking it in two. It isn't that loud of a sound, but it made me realize that I hadn't heard anything else for some time now. Although it is still morning, there is no birdsong, no engine hums, not even drops of rain overhead."

    "Come to think of it, I haven't seen a single person today... Eh, probably nothing."

    "I turn around to leave, but the scenery that greets me is no longer recognizable. The farther I go, the weirder it gets."

    "I complain to myself to ease the discomfort. The scenery has changed drastically from what it used to be. The lush, green forest of before is nowhere to be found, having been taken over by this depressing landscape. Tree roots are growing everywhere, and branches keep hitting me in the face."

    "Even still, the forest is silent and cold."

    "This isn't the woods I know. This is something else entirely."

    "And then, a thought makes me stop."

    p_i "Heh... Hahaha, now that I think about it, all of this reminds me of that fantasy book. What a coincidence."

    "This realization lifts my spirits a little bit. I wonder how Shiori would react to this."

    "Then, I see a figure in the forest. Finally, another person."

    p "Hi there, sorry to bother you, but could you help me find my way out of here?"

    "The figure stops moving. I can't make out what they're saying beyond a quiet grumbling."

    p "Sorry, did you say something? I couldn't hear y-"

    p_i "What is this? Is this a prank? Am I going crazy from lack of sleep?"

    "For what felt like the longest minute of my life, both of us stood there silent and motionless. I didn't even dare to breathe. I remained still until I could take it no more and stepped back."

    "I have never run for so long. I keep on running and running, but the distance between us keeps getting smaller. Like a train, it relentlessly chases me, leaving a trail of steam in its wake."

    "Then a root catches my foot and I fall, landing on my face. I'm dazed by the impact and it feels as though my nose is broken."

    "But there is no time for this. The monster is still chasing. It is gaining on me, reaching out with its hands."

    "Shiori nods with understanding."

    shi "You can, but I'll be honest with you. That's a death sentence. The monster already set its sights on you. It will hunt you until you're kaput."

    shi "With time, it will get stronger and stronger, and it might affect the entire city as it expands its hunting ground. There will be countless victims, and you'll be the first."
