    "Despite the harsh storm, I am able to get home relatively quickly. Thankfully, I managed to keep the books dry. It would have been a hassle to explain to the librarian if they were damaged..."

    "Putting the books aside on the table, I start looking for what to have for dinner tonight. Maybe adding a cucumber would be good. I just hope it's not rotten."

    "While the food is being cooked, I pick up the recommended fantasy book from the pile for a closer look."

    p "'Hunter of Nightmare', huh? Sounds kinda generic, but oh well. She did recommend it to me. Doesn't hurt to take a peek."

    #forest bg

    "The first few pages start with the story of a man looking for his childhood friend who disappeared long ago. But very recently he received a message from her out of nowhere, asking for help. He didn't know specifically what she needed, but he decided to set off immediately."

    "His journey led him to an eerie forest cursed by nightmares. Creatures born here were manifestations of twisted dreams that represented every fear known to mankind." 

    "Because of this, everyone avoided the place. No traces of civilization could be found anywhere close, as humans naturally attract monsters with their fears, empowering them and birthing more horrifying creatures. A vicious cycle that dissuaded even the bravest of kingdoms from stepping near."

    "Recently, there were rumors that even the weather near the forest had turned hostile. A constant rain surrounded the forest like a barrier, showing that no one was welcome."

    "And yet, for some reason, the man's friend was here, asking for help after years of silence."

    "But the man wasn't afraid. Despite the dangers, he headed for the forest, determined to challenge its nightmares with sword and sorcery."

    "His journey was perilous. To get to the forest, he needed to brave the storms and lightning. Many a bolt struck close, yet he endured and pushed through the harsh weather."

    "Entering the forest, he found it quieter than he imaginedâ€”too quiet, in fact. Not a single sound could be heard, not even the wind. The trees inside were malformed, with their branches clinging to him like hands. The roots were no better, snarling around his legs to obstruct his path."

    "After a long day of traveling, the man decided to take a short break. After all that he endured, he needed to rest. Yet, the forest would not give him that. While trying to find a place to sleep, a bright light suddenly flashed from the darkness, prompting him to investigate, sword in hand."

    "What he saw was unlike anything in heaven or earth.  It was taller than the man, hunched and twisted, with naught for a face but horns and fangs and a mane of blazing azure that ran down its back to the end of its heavy rat-like tail."

    "Three-fingered hands grasped at the end of gangly arms, and knobbly legs terminated in cloven hooves. Its chest, gaunt and glowing like a ghostly furnace, heaved as it bellowed at the interloper."

    "Suddenly, it jumped on the knight, intending to rip him to shreds with its claws, but he dodged and struck the monster back. However, the weight of the blow felt different. Rather, there was no weight at all. The sword never struck the monster. It went through it as if it wasn't even there."

    "As the man wasn't ready for this, his momentum caused him to lose his footing. With tree roots restricting his movements, the monster loomed over him, raising its claw as it prepared to strike him down."

    #water boiling sfx

    "I am interrupted by the sudden noise of boiling water. I was so absorbed in reading that I forgot to man the stove, and now the pot boiled over... Great..."

    "I throw the book on the table, saving it for later, as I go to save my dinner. After successfully filling my stomach and cleaning up, I am faced with the hardest choice known to man:"

    "To do homework or not to do homework? That is the question. Looking at the pile of books from the library, it becomes obvious that it will take a long time to read all of them."

    "I sigh. As much as I like leaving things until the last moment, it's better for me to focus on them now. The story can wait."

    #time passes (I don't know how this is commonly presented, quick fade to & from black? -Wax)

    "I fought with the monster named history for hours, but it finally succeeded in bringing about my demise."

    "Tired of this losing battle, I decided to give it a rest. The rain outside has finally ended, so it's quiet enough for me to sleep soundly, anyway. And so, good night!"

    #some time passes

    "It's cold. It's dark. It's wet and scary. All around me I can feel these things with such intensity. I run. And run. I am running. There is no end to this running. Why is there no end? Why am I running? What am I running from?"

    p_i "What is going on?"

    #void background

    #play Hunter bgm

    "The scenery is unfamiliar to me. Countless formless figures float all around. A road stretches on without end under my feet, and the sides drop down into an endless void."

    "I turn around. I see a bright blue fire chasing after me. It can feel its heat scorching my skin even from far away."

    "I continue to run, but it is useless. The fire is hounding me, gaining speed faster than a car. A collision is inevitable."

    "I look back again and see that it is closer. With just a brief glance, I think it is holding out its hand, trying to reach for my throat."

    "I run and I run, until I can run no more. The creature moves closer and closer with each step I don't take. The heat spreads more the longer I don't move. So I leap into the void, praying it will shield me from the flames."

    #room background

    #play BGM_1

    "The next moment, I sit bolt upright in bed, drenched in a cold sweat. The rain is pouring down again, battering the windows incessantly."

    p "... Just a nightmare, huh? Phew."

    "As I reach my right hand to wipe the sweat from my face, I feel a slight sting. Looking at it, there seem to be burn marks on it. The same happened on my left hand as well."

    p "Eh, when did this happen? Was it from the pot? Good thing I have some burn cream in the cabinet."

    "While tending to my wounds, I pour myself some water, trying to shake off the dread. They say that rain helps you relax, so I look outside. Looking at the droplets falling down makes me feel sleepy again. Finally, a benefit to living in this city."

    "With that thought, I drift off to sleep. This time, my dreams are filled with cute cats."

    #campus bg

    #play BGM_2

    "I've decided to walk around the campus this morning. There are things that I should be doing, but the nightmare still makes me uneasy. Perhaps a change of scenery will help."

    "The air is fresh, despite the gloomy sky, and it feels comfortable to stroll around with the raindrops landing softly on my umbrella overhead."

    "As I continue my walk, I stumble upon a road in disrepair that leads to a nearby forest. I remember going there a lot as a child. Now it was all overgrown due to negligence."

    #jogging trail bg

    "Suddenly feeling adventurous, I decide to step in. As I walk through the greenery, the bushes brush gently against my skin. This feels way better than doing homework."

    "At the same time, thoughts about the odd girl from yesterday cross my mind. I really want to see her again, so I should finish up that book quickly so we have something to talk about."

    "While distracted by my thoughts, I stepped on a stick, breaking it in two. It isn't that loud of a sound, but it made me realize that I hadn't heard anything else for some time now. Although it is still morning, there is no birdsong, no engine hums, not even drops of rain overhead."

    "Come to think of it, I haven't seen a single person today... Eh, probably nothing."

    #play cursed forest bg

    "I shrug it off and continue walking down the path. The longer I walk, the more the forest changes. The trees are gnarled and dead, the sky darkens, and the path has begun to turn to mud."

    p_i "Maybe I should go back."

    "I turn around to leave, but the scenery that greets me is no longer recognizable. The farther I go, the weirder it gets."

    p_i "Maybe I made a wrong turn somewhere. Yeah, that's probably it. If I keep going, eventually I'll make it out. Right?"

    "My self-reassurance did little to change the fact that nothing has changed. An hour has passed, and I am still in the forest."

    #thunderstorm sfx

    p_i "I don't like this at all. How did I even manage to get lost staying on the path in the first place? Now it's gonna start pouring again... And what's up with those trees? Awful."

    "I complain to myself to ease the discomfort. The scenery has changed drastically from what it used to be. The lush, green forest of before is nowhere to be found, having been taken over by this depressing landscape. Tree roots are growing everywhere, and branches keep hitting me in the face."

    "Even still, the forest is silent and cold."

    "This isn't the woods I know. This is something else entirely."

    "And then, a thought makes me stop."

    p_i "Heh... Hahaha, now that I think about it, all of this reminds me of that fantasy book. What a coincidence."

    "This realization lifts my spirits a little bit. I wonder how Shiori would react to this."

    "Then, I see a figure in the forest. Finally, another person."

    p "Hi there, sorry to bother you, but could you help me find my way out of here?"

    "The figure stops moving. I can't make out what they're saying beyond a quiet grumbling."

    p "Sorry, did you say something? I couldn't hear y-"

    "I stop, feeling that there's something wrong."

    "As the figure cranes its neck toward me, its body still as a statue, I can't believe my eyes."

    #monster calm sprite

    p_i "Whatever this thing is, it can't be human. This is a monster out of a nightmare!"

    p_i "My nightmare!"

    "I recognize it now. It was that thing. The one chasing me in the dream. The same one from that book. How?!"

    p_i "What is this? Is this a prank? Am I going crazy from lack of sleep?"

    "For what felt like the longest minute of my life, both of us stood there silent and motionless. I didn't even dare to breathe. I remained still until I could take it no more and stepped back."

    "It was as if that was a trigger for the monster, as it darted at me, setting itself alight with eerie flames."

    #monster angry sprite

    #monster charge sfx

    p "What?!"

    #monster angry sprite disappears

    "Surprised by the drastic turn of events, I booked it as fast as I could. It is hard to run in this godforsaken forest, with the roots trying to trip me up at every turn, but adrenaline keeps me afloat in this sea of trees."

    "I have never run for so long. I keep on running and running, but the distance between us keeps getting smaller. Like a train, it relentlessly chases me, leaving a trail of steam in its wake."

    "Then a root catches my foot and I fall, landing on my face. I'm dazed by the impact and it feels as though my nose is broken."

    "But there is no time for this. The monster is still chasing. It is gaining on me, reaching out with its hands."

    "In a last-ditch attempt, I throw a rock at it, but it just passes through the monster."

    p_i "Just like in the book?! Shoot, I should have kept reading!"

    "I feel defeated. There is nothing I can do besides accept my fate. "

    #fade to black

    k "Pathetic."

    "I hear an unfamiliar voice and open my eyes to look."

    #fade back to trail bg

    #Knight appears

    "Just before the monster reaches me, a woman stands between us. Her scarlet hair and bright clothes make her stand out against this gray forest."

    #sword clash 1 sfx

    "She swings her sword at the monster, but it deflects and counters with its claw, piercing her chest."

    #Knight illusion

    "However, the woman disappears like mist and suddenly reappears behind the monster, slashing its head off."

    #Monster sprite (angry form) appears

    "The head falls and burns to a crisp, staring sightlessly at the woman until the very end."

    #Monster sprite (angry form) disappears

    "Seeing the monster dead, I sit up, trying to process what just happened. Is this still a dream? No. It can't be. The pain in my nose is too real for it to be a dream."

    #Knight appears

    k "How long are you going to sit there? Move, we need to go."

    "The woman speaks with a commanding voice. Her face is covered with a mask."

    p "Oh, sorry. Thank you for saving me. Thought I was a goner."

    k "You will be if we don't leave. That thing is still alive and will come back to finish the job soon."

    "My face loses all color. What does that mean?"

    k "... I'm leaving. Follow me or keep wandering around aimlessly for all I care."

    #Knight disappears

    #play outside music short bgm

    "She waves her hand dismissively, already walking away through the trees."

    "I refocus and follow her. Better than being alone."

    p "Uh, what is your name? Also, what's going on here? I was in a normal forest just an hour ago, and now I'm getting chased by monsters!"

    #Knight appears

    "The lady pauses and looks around, only continuing walking after she's scanned the nearby forest."

    k "You may call me Knight. As you are, you are not worthy of knowing my name. As for what is going on... I don't feel like explaining. If you want to know, keep walking. Queen will tell you everything."

    p "Queen?"

    "Knight doesn't respond. It's evident that she doesn't care to answer any more questions."

    #Knight sprite (base pose) disappears

    "We keep moving in silence, stopping to wait out the blue flames that sporadically flicker to life deeper amidst the trees."

    #castle bg

    "Finally, we reach our destination. It's a castle, gothic in its architecture, looking as if it had sprouted fresh after the evening's rain."

    "Unlike the forest, which was like a living nightmare, the castle gives off an otherworldly air. It feels so out-of-place and... unnatural."

    #Knight appears

    k "Welcome to Inkwell Castle: the base of a little princess who wants to build her dream here."

    "My brow furrows in confusion. What she said just now was complete nonsense. Inkwell? Princess? A dream?"

    p_i "Isn't this just a plot out of a fantasy novel?"

    "We enter the castle through the main gate. The imposing halls are empty yet clean. Odd, considering no maids or servants can be seen anywhere."

    #throne room bg

    "When we reach the throne room, the big doors swing openly solemnly on either side, revealing a large chamber that echoes with each step."

    #Shiori neutral

    #play exposition track bgm

    "And then, I see her. In the center of the room, sitting upon the throne, is Shiori Novella, reading the very same book from before."

    "Upon laying my eyes on her, my jaw almost drops."

    #Rook weapon appears

    "A man wearing medieval plate armor and holding an antique gun with an axe-bayonet is nonchalantly sitting on the steps leading up to her. Seeing my surprised face he chuckles quietly." 

    #Rooks disappears, Happy Shiori sprite

    shi "Oh! You're finally here! I'm glad you made it safely. Good job Knight."

    "She closes her book and addresses the woman."

    #Shiori disappears, Knight appears

    k "I still don't know why you need someone like this. Are you sure someone so weak will be of use?"

    #Knight disappears 

    p_i "Ouch..."

    "After that sucker punch to my ego, she walks over to Shiori and whips out a nail file. Clearly, this is all beneath her."

    #Shiori normal

    shi "Aw don't be like that. Anyway, come here. We need to talk."

    "Shiori turns to you with a smile, and she waves for you to approach her."

    p "So, Shiori, can you please tell me what's going on? I think I'm about to lose it. What was that monster? Why is it here? Why did it try to kill me?! What's this about a princess and a queen, and why is everything like that book you gave me???"

    #shiori normalclosed

    shi "Alright, ok. Lemme explain it step by step."

    shi "You see, this world was partially merged with the book. Parts of the cursed forest slowly integrated into this world, along with some natives. Just like that monster you met and Rook over there."

    "She points to the man, who gives me a friendly wave."

    #Rook cross-armed appears

    r "Good day."

    #Rook disappears

    #happy Shiori appears

    shi "So Queen is my codename, even though I'm a princess. You should see the pattern now that you've met everyone. But don't worry, you'll get one too!"

    "She winks at me with a grin. A cloud blots out the sunlight filtering into the room and Shiori looks pensively out the window."

    shi "The weather also got much worse around here thanks to the storm also bleeding out from the book."

    p "Wait, what? This is some pseudo-fantasy stuff."

    shi "Well, like it or not, it's real now. I gave you an early warning, hoping you would read it, so you would be prepared when the time comes."

    #shiori sad

    shi "Unfortunately, it all happened way too fast."

    "I don't know how to react."

    p "O-ok, but what do I have to do with anything?!"

    #Shiori serious

    "Shiori looks into my eyes, choosing her words carefully."

    shi "Have you seen the monster? In the story, it lives in a place called the Dreamscape. It is a powerful creature that feeds on dreams. Even worse, it is practically immortal since it can hide in the Dreamscape unless you catch it off-guard."

    shi "But worst of all, it keeps returning even if you kill it. The one that tried to kill you was just one of many manifestations, there have been more."

    p "So, it's immortal..."

    shi "In a sense, yes. But you're the key to all of this. That's why the monster tried to kill you. Tell me, have you had any bad dreams recently?"

    p "I did last night."

    "Shiori nods in satisfaction."

    shi "That confirms it, that thing sees you as a threat."

    p_i "Me? A threat to that?"

    shi "If I'm right, you have the ability to traverse the Dreamscape. You know how sometimes people can control their own dreams? This is kinda like the better version of that."

    shi "Also, you might even be able to pull things from dreams into reality! But that's something we don't know for sure."

    "I scratch my head. Pull something from dreams? Walking through them? What does she mean? I don't recall doing any of that."

    "As if reading my thoughts, Shiori taps on my shoulder."

    shi "Don't worry, I'll help you with it. Obviously, no one can instantly cast magic. But before that, you have to make a decision."

    p "A decision?"

    shi "Yes. This is a dangerous mission, and I don't want to include anyone who isn't willing to risk their lives. So, what say you? Will you join us in hunting the monster?"

    "A monster hunt. Would've been exciting if I hadn't already seen it. The idea of seeing it again makes my knees weak."

    p "...A- And what if I refuse?"

    "Shiori nods with understanding."

    shi "You can, but I'll be honest with you. That's a death sentence. The monster already set its sights on you. It will hunt you until you're kaput."

    shi "With time, it will get stronger and stronger, and it might affect the entire city as it expands its hunting ground. There will be countless victims, and you'll be the first."

    "Well that sounds awful, but what can I do? Everything is happening so fast."

    #Shiori disappears, show Knight wine & Rook weapon

    "I look at Knight drinking straight from a bottle of wine directly through her mask. It's a bit surreal to watch, but after everything that's happened today, this seems practically normal by comparison. Then I look at Rook, who had disassembled and was in the process of cleaning his blunderbuss. Lastly, I look at Shiori, who was returning my gaze without blinking, waiting for my answer."

    #Knight & Rook disappear, show Shiori serious

    p "Guess I have no choice. Well, at least I'm not dying alone this way."

    #Shiori excited

    shi "Yay!"

    "Shiori almost jumps for joy."

    shi "A- Ahem! I mean, thank you."

    "She tries to look dignified, but the attempt only gets a poorly-stifled giggle out of Knight."

    shi "Now then, for the time being, I shall name you Bishop. I am your Queen, and together we shall vanquish this harbinger of calamity!"
